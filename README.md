With most of the country’s population vaccinated against COVID-19 and a similar movement taking place concurrently across the globe, Singapore has accelerated its shift towards a COVID-endemic strategy. Prompted by the need to jumpstart the economy, measures have been passed to allow the country and various sectors of the economy to re-open gradually.  Part and parcel of these reforms is the relaxation of border control measures. As of October 2021, vaccinated travellers from eight (8) countries were allowed to enter the country without the need for self-quarantine. That list has since expanded to include thirteen (13) countries on top of comparatively looser restrictions for jurisdictions not yet part of Singapore’s Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL) program.
